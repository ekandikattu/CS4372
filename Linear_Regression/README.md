# Linear Regression Analysis
### Due: 9/21/2025

## Project Description
This assignment requires you to build linear regression model in Python using standard machine learning libraries.

## Dataset
### Wine Quality Dataset
Context: This dataset is related to the white variant of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The goal is to model wine quality based on physicochemical tests.
Classes are ordered and not balanced. There are no missing values.
